                    Hi there.
                </H1>
            </p>
            <p>
                MY NAME IS JULES and I'm a design fellow/type nerd at 
                <u><b>Sequoia Capital</b></u> in Menlo Park. I've also worked as a product 
                designer at <u><b>Chain</b></u> and <u><b>Medium</b></u>, and was one of <u><b>Designer 
                Fund's</b></u> Bridge Designers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I like building design systems that prioritize consistency over 
                pixel-perfection. Let's get coffie?
